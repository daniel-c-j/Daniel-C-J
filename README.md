# About me

Daniel CJ here.

I'm a digital technology ethusiast, currently lurking in the mobile development world, mainly Flutter. I also do scripting with Python either for automation or destroying Operating Systems.

There isn't a lot that stands out as interesting about me. I just like learning something new because I find it entertaining and addicting (Just like caffeine☕).
